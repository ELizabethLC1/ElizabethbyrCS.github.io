      <h1 class= "DRAMtitle"> DRAM </h1>
      <p>Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) plays a pivotal role in the world of computing as a type of volatile semiconductor memory used for temporary data storage. DRAM is the primary form of memory utilized in most personal computers and electronic devices. Its key attribute is its ability to store data in a capacitor within each memory cell, which must be periodically refreshed to maintain the data, as it tends to leak away over time. Despite this need for periodic refreshing, DRAM offers a balance between capacity, speed, and cost-effectiveness, making it suitable for applications where high-speed, temporary data storage is essential. In modern computers, DRAM is used as system memory, providing fast access to data for active processes and applications, thus contributing significantly to overall system performance.</p>

      <h2> History of DRAM</h2>
      <p2>DRAM emerged in the late 1960s as an evolution of earlier random access memory technologies. The first DRAM chips were introduced in the early 1970s, marking a significant improvement in memory density and cost-effectiveness compared to previous memory technologies like magnetic core memory. Over the years, DRAM technology has gone through numerous generations, with each new iteration offering increased capacity, faster access times, and improved energy efficiency. Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) and Double Data Rate (DDR) SDRAM are some of the notable developments that have improved data transfer rates. The demand for greater RAM capacity in personal computers and electronic devices has driven the continuous evolution of DRAM technology, leading to innovations like DDR4 and DDR5 DRAM modules that cater to the performance needs of modern computing and the increasing demands of data-intensive applications.
