      <h1 class= "memorytitle">Memory</h1>
      <p>Memory refers to the location of short-term data, while storage refers to the location of data stored on a long-term basis. Memory is most often referred to as the primary storage on a computer, such as RAM. Memory is also where information is processed. It enables users to access data that is stored for a short time.Computer memory operates at a high speed compared to storage which is slower but less expensive and higher in capacity. Besides storing opened programs, computer memory serves as disk cache and write buffer to improve both reading and writing performance. Operating systems borrow RAM capacity for caching so long as not needed by running software. If needed, contents of the computer memory can be transferred to storage; a common way of doing this is through a memory management technique called virtual memory.</p>

      <h2> History of Memory</h2>
      <p2>In the early days of computing, memory was primarily stored in the form of vacuum tubes and relays, which were bulky, power-hungry, and prone to frequent failures. The introduction of the first electronic, solid-state memory in the 1940s marked a significant advancement, but it was still limited in capacity and reliability. The breakthrough came with the invention of the transistor in the late 1940s, which led to the development of magnetic core memory in the 1950s, a more reliable and efficient memory technology. As computers became smaller and more powerful, integrated circuits and silicon-based memory chips emerged in the 1960s, paving the way for the RAM (Random Access Memory) we use today. Over the years, memory capacity has grown exponentially while physical size has shrunk, enabling the incredible computing capabilities we now take for granted in modern devices.
